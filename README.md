- 👋 Hi, I’m @EstherRuizSempere.
- 👀 I’m interested in learning as much as possible to produce quality work. I'm very detail-oriented and I like everything to work perfectly, although... who hasn't experienced situations where things work but you're not sure why?
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything related to the programming world. There are so many things that I find interesting. I consider myself a bit addicted when I create a program and see that it works... does anyone else feel this way? On a more serious note, I'm diving into Java, JavaScript, HTML5, CSS, MariaDB, MongoDB, ...
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with anyone or any project that helps me learn and make mistakes—yes, you read that right! After all, we learn the most from our mistakes, though it's better if they're fixable!
- 📫 How to reach me... You can email me at estherruizsempere@gmail.com
- ⚡ Fun fact: Did you know I come from the world of makeup? I've been passionate about electronics and video games my whole life, but I thought they were only for leisure... until I dived into this world and became passionate about it. You never know where you'll end up 😎
